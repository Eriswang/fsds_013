## Executive Summary

This report will conduct an analysis of the supply and demand side of the London Airbnb rental market before and after the epidemic, focusing on changes in different administrative regions. The number of listings will serve as an indicator of changes on the supply side, while the number of properties remaining per listing will serve as an indicator of the demand side of the market. According to the changes in the number of listings before and after the epidemic and the number of reviews on listings, the report will summarize the opportunities and risks that the epidemic has brought to the Airbnb rental market. The report concludes with recommendations on policy for the existing short-term letting market in London. This paper answers three main questions.

1.  How has the Airbnb rental market changed before and after the epidemic?

2.  What are the changes in the supply side of the market before and after the epidemic?

3.  How did the market demand change before and after the epidemic?

Key findings:

1.  Comparing the number of listings in 2019 and 2022, only five boroughs have reduced the number of listings, of which **Tower Hamlets** has the largest **reduction** of **18.78%**. Among other areas showing growth, **Bexley** is the area with the largest **increase** in the number of listings, reaching **61.31%**.
2.  According to the number of listings needed by the market defined by the number of messages and the time of the last message, **Bexley** is the area with the largest **increase** in the number of listings in demand, with an increase of **46.76%**. **Tower Hamlets**, on the other hand, saw a **127.2%** reduction in the number of listings being requested.

According to the number of listings needed by the market defined by the number of messages and the time of the last message, Bexley is the region with the largest increase in the number of listings in demand, with an increase of 46.76%. Tower Hamlets, on the other hand, saw a 127.2% reduction in the number of listings being requested.

### 1.2 Short-Term Rentals in London and outside London

-   Short-term letting duration inside London (As per the Govt guidelines): **Maximum of 90 nights** in a calendar year, post obtaining planning permission

-   Short-term letting duration outside London (as per the Govt. guidelines): No restriction on the number of nights/ days per property outside London.

## Methods

The purpose of this report is to explore the impact of the epidemic on the Airbnb short-term rental market, based on the changes in data before and after the epidemic. Therefore, in this report, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is mainly used to summarize the main characteristics of the housing data before and after the epidemic provided by Insideairbnb, and no formal modeling has been made.

## Findings

### Supply-overview

-   Combining the data of 2019 and 2022 with Figure 1, only **4 boroughs** saw a **decrease** in the number of listings after the epidemic, and the remaining **29 boroughs** all showed an **upward** trend.

-   In the statistics of the number of listings in 2019 and 2022, Westminster, Tower Hamlets, Hackney, Camden, Kensington and Chelsea, these five boroughs are the top five areas with the biggest number of listings. But it is worth noting that the total number of listings in the **Tower Hamlets** and **Camden** areas has **declined**, falling by **18.78%** and **1.89%** respectively.

-   The number of listings in the **Bexley** area increased from 159 to 411, an **increase** of **61.3%**, the largest increase in all areas.

### Supply-Availability

Can these listings be offered on the real market?To understand the real market situation, I decided to use the availability of the data for the next 365 days to see the real and effective listings.

-   It can be seen from the map that the listings of the entire London are still concentrated in the central area, and the overall **availability of rental listings** is concentrated **below 150 days**.

-   There are now two possibilities for this:

    Many listings have been rented for almost half of the time in the next 365 days, which shows that Airbnb is very popular in the short-term rental market, so the **short-term rental market is active** in 2019.

    There is also the possibility that landlords are limiting the length of time their listings can be rented out, when **landlords in 2019 preferred less than 5 months**.

### Demand

Review is the key indicator that can represent market demand in the data set. Therefore, when processing data, last reviewed date were used to filter listings that are needed by the market. In the same way, when a listing has not been commented for nearly a year, it proves that the demand for the listing in the short-term rental market is no longer considered.

-   As can be seen from Figure 1, the number of listings were needed (favored) by the market is generally greater in 2019 than in 2022.

-   As far as the demand side is concerned, only 4 boroughs' listings have increased in number, of which **Bexley** has the largest **increase,** **reaching 46.76%**. Listings for the remaining 29 boroughs all fell. It is worth noting that the number of listings in the two areas of **Islington** and **Tower Hamlets** **fell** by **100.3%** and **127.23%** respectively.
